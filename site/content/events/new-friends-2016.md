Illah R. Nourbakhsh, professor of robotics at The Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University of the United States gave the inaugural lecture entitled 'Robotics and the fluidity of technology', where based on his innovative current research projects, he talked about robotics in the community framework, how people and communities can benefit or be affected by these technologies, and how communities can influence their future through their use.

The conference, which held its first edition in Holland, brings together the most important experts and research groups from around the world in Social Robotics, which for three days, will participate in an intense program of keynote lectures, poster presentations, workshops and debates . The objective is to present and discuss the most recent results of their research, advances and trials, within the framework of a general vision, of the state of this research so far and which faces important technological, scientific, social and legal challenges.
