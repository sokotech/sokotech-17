Maker Faire originated in 2006 in the San Francisco Bay Area as a project of the editors of Make: magazine.  It has since grown into a significant worldwide network of both flagship and independently-produced events.

Barcelona Maker Faire is co-organized by Sonar+D, Fab Lab Barcelona and Soko Tech, with the support of Make magazine, Barcelona City Hall, IN(3D)USTRY and Obra Social ‘La Caxia’.
