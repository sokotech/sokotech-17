Since 2006, Smashing Magazine has been delivering useful and innovative information to web designers and developers around the world. The design community is full of talented and hard-working folks who come up with brilliant ideas every day. We provide a platform to share and discuss the work and knowledge of the best designers and developers out there, chase down the latest developments in the industry and stay on top of new techniques, methods, workflows and tricks.

The conference moves beyond online communication and aims to bring web designers and developers closer together. We want to provide a forward-thinking event where people can connect and network with others on a personal level in a beautiful yet friendly environment.
